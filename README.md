# MindQuest ðŸ§ 

MindQuest is a web-based quiz application that allows users to upload quizzes in a simple text format. Once uploaded, the application parses the file to extract questions, answer choices, and correct answers. It then presents the quiz interactively, showing one question at a time to the user.

This project is ideal for educators, students, or anyone who wants a quick and customizable way to create and take quizzes without manually entering each question into a form. MindQuest focuses on simplicity, speed, and user-friendly interaction, making quiz creation and participation seamless and intuitive.

At the end of the quiz, users receive instant feedback with their total score and a summary of their answers.
